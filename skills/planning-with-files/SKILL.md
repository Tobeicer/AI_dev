# Planning with Files

Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## FIRST: Restore Context

**Before doing anything else**, check if planning files exist and read them:
1. If `task_plan.md` exists, read `task_plan.md`, `progress.md`, and `findings.md` immediately.
2. Then check for unsynced context from a previous session.

If catchup report shows unsynced context:
1. Run `git diff --stat` to see actual code changes
2. Read current planning files
3. Update planning files based on catchup + git diff
4. Then proceed with task

## The Core Pattern

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** — Phase tracking with checkboxes
2. **Create `findings.md`** — Research storage
3. **Create `progress.md`** — Session logging
4. **Re-read plan before decisions** — Refreshes goals in attention window
5. **Update after each phase** — Mark complete, log errors

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule
After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files. This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

### 3. Read Before Decide
Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

### 4. Update After Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered
- Note files created/modified

### 5. Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.

### 6. Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```
Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.

### 7. Continue After Completion
When all phases are done but the user requests additional work:
- Add new phases to `task_plan.md`
- Log a new session entry in `progress.md`

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix → Read error, identify root cause, apply fix
ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach → Different method? Different tool?
ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink → Question assumptions, search for solutions
AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
```

## The 5-Question Reboot Test

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | findings.md |
| What have I done? | progress.md |

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating projects
- Tasks spanning many tool calls

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create task_plan.md file |
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions |
| Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
| Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
| Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach |
